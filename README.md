 JS Assignment

This project is a dynamic To-Do List application where users can manage a list of items. The list is built using vanilla JavaScript, with features to add, remove, and persist data using localStorage.

üöÄ Features

	1.	Dynamic List Creation:
	‚Ä¢	Create an HTML list by looping through an array of objects.
	‚Ä¢	Each list item displays its content and includes a remove button/icon to delete it from the array.

	2.	Item Management:
	‚Ä¢	Add new items to the list using a text input and button.
	‚Ä¢	Remove specific items from the array using the delete button/icon.

	3.	Empty List Handling:
	‚Ä¢	When the array becomes empty, a message is displayed to inform the user.

	4.	LocalStorage Integration:
	‚Ä¢	Save the list to localStorage to persist data.
	‚Ä¢	Retrieve and display the saved list on page load.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

	‚Ä¢	HTML5: For structuring the user interface.
	‚Ä¢	CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript (ES6): To add interactivity and manage the array logic.
	‚Ä¢	localStorage: For data persistence.

üìã Requirements

To run this project, you‚Äôll need:
	‚Ä¢	A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
	‚Ä¢	A code editor like VS Code to make modifications if needed.


üß∞ Functionalities

1. Dynamic List Creation

	‚Ä¢	The app loops through an array to create a list dynamically.
	‚Ä¢	Each list item includes:
	‚Ä¢	Text content (e.g., the item name).
	‚Ä¢	A delete button/icon to remove the item from the list.

2. Adding New Items

	‚Ä¢	Use the input field to add new items to the array.
	‚Ä¢	Each new item has the same structure as existing items in the list.

3. Removing Items

	‚Ä¢	Click the remove button/icon on an item to delete it from the array.
	‚Ä¢	Updates are reflected immediately on the page.

4. Empty Array Handling

	‚Ä¢	When the list becomes empty, a message such as "No items in the list" is displayed to the user.

5. LocalStorage Persistence

	‚Ä¢	The app saves the list to localStorage whenever it‚Äôs updated.
	‚Ä¢	On page load, the list is retrieved from localStorage, ensuring data is not lost after a browser refresh.

 Future Improvements

	1.	Edit Functionality:
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to edit existing items directly from the list.

	2.	Sorting:
	‚Ä¢	Enable sorting by name, creation date, or custom criteria.

	3.	Search Bar:
	‚Ä¢	Add a search bar to filter the displayed items dynamically.

	4.	UI/UX Enhancements:
	‚Ä¢	Add animations when items are added or removed.
	‚Ä¢	Improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA roles).

üß™ Learning Highlights

	‚Ä¢	Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Looping through arrays and dynamically updating HTML elements.
	‚Ä¢	State Management: Managing the array state efficiently using JavaScript.
	‚Ä¢	Data Persistence: Using localStorage to save and retrieve the list data.
	‚Ä¢	JavaScript Events: Handling click events for adding and removing items.
