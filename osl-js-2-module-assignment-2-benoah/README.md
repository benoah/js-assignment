# JavaScript 2 Module Assignment 

## Brief

Use the array of objects in this repo this [repo](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/ma-javascript2-module2) for Level 1.

Use modules (imports/exports) where you think they are appropriate.

## Level 1 Process

- Loop through the array and create an HTML list from each item.
- Add a button or icon to each item that removes that particular item from the array.
- When there are no more items in the array display a message.

## Level 2 Process (reminder: level 2 is optional)

- Create the list from an empty array that you use a text input and button to add new objects to. The objects can have the same structure as the array from level 1.
- Each item should have a button or icon that removes it from the array.
- Save the list to and retrieve it from localStorage.

## Delivery

### Submission

- Push all changes to Github Classroom Repository
- Submit PDF with a GitHub Repository URL inside of it
